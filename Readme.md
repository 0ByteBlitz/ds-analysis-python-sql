# Analyzing CSV Data with PostgreSQL and Python - Querying PostgreSQL Database with Python

## Project Description
The main aim of this project is to practice SQL, Python, and Pandas. 
We will be using PostgreSQL to analyze a dataset of international students and their mental health. 
Python and Pandas will be used to interact with the database and analyze the data.

The project aims to investigate the impact of studying abroad on the mental health of international students. 
We will analyze student data using PostgreSQL to determine if the length of stay plays a role in their mental health.
